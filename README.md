# Santa Claus Is Not Real
A poster that I distribute (and you should too) to spread the undoubtedly true fact that Santa Claus does not exist. Look for it on public message boards around Toronto (if nobody took them down). Print them out and post them too! Help spread the word! Pull requests are welcome.  
(Note: It is legal to post community posters on utility poles and kiosks in Toronto, with certain conditions. See the City of Toronto bylaws for more details.)  

## The files
The posters were made in Microsoft Word 2016 and LibreOffice 6.4. The Word documents also require that the Liberation fonts be installed on your computer. (I really like LibreOffice's default fonts for some reason. They look modern and like the '90s at the same time. They were also exported as PDF files, so you can just print them out directly without worrying about the formatting being incorrect.

## Print runs
The numbers below keep track of how many copies were printed of each version of the poster. The posters get taken down quickly, so they usually don't last long.  
* 1.0 - ~40 copies (originally distributed as brochure, later posted as poster, distribution complete, mostly taken down)  
* 2.0 - 100 copies  (distribution complete)
* 2.0.1 - 101 copies (distribution complete)  
* 2.0.2 - 100 copies on 2020-12-09 (currently being distributed, 30% complete)  

## Known posting locations
These are the locations I remember posting the posters. They get removed pretty quickly (sometimes within 15 minutes), and I need to repost them several times a week. If you posted them too, feel free to open a pull request and have the location added to the list. As a courtesy, please don't remove them.
