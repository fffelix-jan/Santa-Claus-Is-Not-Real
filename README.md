# Santa-Claus-Is-Not-Real
A brochure that I distrbute (and you should too) to spread the undoubtedly true fact that Santa Claus does not exist. Look for it on public message boards along Queen Street West in Toronto (if nobody took them down). Print them out and distribute them too! Help spread the word! Pull requests are welcome.
