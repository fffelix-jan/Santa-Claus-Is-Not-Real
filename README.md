# Santa Claus Is Not Real
A poster that I distribute (and you should too) to spread the undoubtedly true fact that Santa Claus does not exist. Look for it on public message boards around Toronto (if nobody took them down). Print them out and post them too! Help spread the word! Pull requests are welcome.  
(Note: It is legal to post community posters on utility poles and kiosks in Toronto, with certain conditions. See the City of Toronto bylaws for more details.)  

## Print runs
The numbers below keep track of how many copies were printed of each version of the poster.
